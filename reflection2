It is quite exciting to attend FSN event most especially that of DLS-CSB.  
Having experienced that made me feel so proud about the school I am in. During the FSN proper, 
I was enlightened and bacame aware of the school's rules and policies, different facilities, 
courses it offers,administrators of the school, and of course the different affiliations of De La Salle University.
Moreover, this event is one of a kind as it let frosh experienced a truly memorable fellowship night.  
It was a party for blockmates and schoolmates alike that made me feel like calling it an "Acquaintance Party" from the word itself acquaintance,
it made us get acquainted and familiar with one another.  In the end, we all went ome winning a friend or two.
