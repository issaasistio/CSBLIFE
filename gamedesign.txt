I'm interested in how the market of casual games is split up between different platforms, both in terms of revenue as well as "amount of games published".
For example, I think that Facebook and iPhone games should make a quite large percentage of the market, Facebook alone due to the *Ville games

I personally find this topic (Casual Games Market Share Distribution) an interesting one. Being a student of Game Design Development, it is just natural that this topic catch my attention.  Thinking about my future career after graduating in this field, it is relevant to know and find out how Casual Games fair in the market.  

From time to time, I will be interested to know if the course I am currently taking up will still boom in the market 3 to 4 years from now.

Every year, new programs, social networks, and casual games are being introduced in our modern society.  It is interesting to find out and be aware of its existence as well as its revenue in the the world market.
