1. have you ever failed an exam? what were the reasons for failing?
Yes, I've experience it in my highschool days the reason why i failed is when i was stdying i didnt focus on what i am studying on because sometimes i used to play, using facebook and texting thats whyi failed and sometimes what i've learn isnt enough.



2. how was your first experience of csb midterm examinations? knowing what you know now, what you would have you done differently?
well all i can say is that it was moderate. i will study harder to have a higher grades and to focus on what i am reviewing or studying
